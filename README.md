# GBG Cycle Tours
GBG Cycle Tours is a tour website hoping to encourage people to book a guided bicycle tour around the city of Gothenburg, Sweden.
The site is aimed at tourists visiting the city particulary, but also for local people who are interested in learning more about the history of the city that they live in. The site also attempts to encourage people to be more active and environmentally friendly by travelling around (or in this case sightseeing) in a sustainable manner while keeping healthy at the same time!

The website will be useful by providing important information on the details of the tour and hopefully encouraging people to visit the city and join them for a bicycle tour. Information on the itinerary and attractive pictures of Gothenburg are included throughout the website to give a glimpse of all the beautiful sights there are to see!

## Current Features

 ### Navigation bar 

 - The navigation bar is featured on all three pages and includes interactive links to jump to the other sections of the website. The company logo is in the top left and takes you back to the home page when clicked.
 
 - The links take you to either Home, Tour Information or Book a Tour. This lets you easily switch between pages without the need of using the back button constantly.

 ### The main image 

 - This first initial image gives a good idea to what this website is all about. It shows a person cycling through the city of Gothenburg.

 - The text overlay is an attention grabbing title along with a call to action button which when clicked, takes you to the book a tour page.

 ### Welcome section and Table 

 - This paragraph of text gives you a brief introduction of Gothenburg and what can be expected during the tour.

 - The table shows information on the days, times and price of the tour. I laid it out in a table to make that information clear and easily noticeable for somebody glancing over the homepage.

 - This section would be updated regularly to keep people up to date on any changes in times or dates.

 ### Why take a bike tour section

 - This section is aimed to show people why taking a bike tour is the best way to see a city!
 It lists out several reasons why cycling is great to do, along with encouraging the user to sign up for our tour.

 - To the right of this, is an appealing image of people riding bicycles to add some style to the section.

 ### Footer

 - Like the navigation, the footer is located on all three pages. It includes links to all the relevant social media which open in a new tab. To the left, there is included copyright information.

 - The footer is valuable as it promotes the company on their other social channels and encourages the user to stay connected with us.

 ### Tour Information page 

 - The top of the page once again includes a large attractive image to grab the users attention. This page is valuable to the user as it outlines important information regarding the meetup times and what to bring with you etc.

 - This page includes meetup information and a more thorough breakdown of the tours itinerary. A map is included at the bottom of the page with a pin showing exactly where the meetup point in the city is.

 ## Testing

 - I have tested that the website works on the following different browsers : Chrome, Safari & Firefox.
 - I have ensured that the site is responsive and works well on different screen sizes. I have tested this in the development tools bar. 
 - I have tested that the form works as expected. Before you can submit, it ensures that all of the required details are filled in. Also, that an email address is required for the email input, a telephone number for the telephone input etc.
 - Once the form is submitted, it takes you to a confirmation page showing that your information has been received.

 ## Unfixed Bugs

- I encountered some issues with performance when i ran lighthouse tests for mobile rather than desktop. This bought my score down to around 80. I did not have time to work on fixing this unfortunately.

- The way i positioned some elements on the home page early on in development meant that when it came to responsive design, a few of the elements on the main-image section are not cohesive on all size screens.

- I noticed that when the home page and form was in landscape on certain mobile devices, some elements were pushed up the screen into the navigation bar. I fixed this by adding extra media queries to account for when devices are in landscape orientation.
